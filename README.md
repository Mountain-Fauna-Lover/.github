## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**What equipment do you use?**
We use professional-grade camera systems with telephoto lenses suitable for wildlife photography, along with stabilization equipment and drones (where permitted). Specific gear recommendations vary based on budget and experience level.

**How do you approach wildlife without disturbing them?**
We maintain safe distances using telephoto lenses, move slowly and predictably, avoid breeding seasons and sensitive areas, and prioritize animal behavior over getting shots. Patience and respect are our primary tools.

**Do you organize photography workshops or tours?**
Currently, we focus primarily on content creation. However, we are considering educational workshops in the future. Subscribe to our channels to stay informed about any upcoming events.

**Can I use your photos for my school project?**
Yes, for educational purposes with proper attribution. Please email us with details about your project.

### Technical Questions

**What settings do you recommend for wildlife photography?**
Settings vary greatly based on lighting, subject distance, and desired effect. Generally: fast shutter speeds (1/1000s+), wide apertures for subject isolation, and auto-ISO for flexibility. Learning to read light and anticipate behavior is more important than specific settings.

**How do you find wildlife in the mountains?**
Success comes from research, local knowledge, understanding animal behavior and habitat preferences, early morning starts, patience, and respect for the environment. Time spent observing beats time spent walking.

**What permits do you need to film in national parks?**
Requirements vary by park. Professional filming often requires permits, while casual photography generally doesn't. Always check specific park regulations before planning a trip.

### Collaboration Questions

**Do you accept free products for review?**
We only work with brands that align with our conservation values. Product reviews must allow for honest assessment. Contact us with specific proposals.

**Can you feature my conservation project?**
We're always interested in supporting legitimate conservation efforts. Please email with details about your project, its goals, and how we might collaborate.

**Are you available for speaking engagements?**
Potentially, depending on the event, audience, and alignment with our mission. Please reach out with specific details.
